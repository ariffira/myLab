### Title: Development of a web-platform to support Project based learning(PBL)

During the last decade, the maker movement gathered new momentum. A growing number of Fabrication Labs(Fab-Labs) provides facilities for micro fabrication also aiming for educational use. Microcontroller such as Arduino are dedicated and well suited for in school usage. This has been underpinned by many curricula and the research in the pedagogical field of project-based learning(PBL). To effectively support learning, software system to support PBL are needed.
The goal of the thesis is to analyses and identify important aspects and workflows of PBL, and to design and develop a web-based software system to support students in their activities in conducting projects. Four important activities in the context of this thesis are the “sharing of ideas” (idea generation and refinement; driving questions), “project planning/organization”, “sharing of showcases”, “documentation” and “presentation” of final products. The concept of “flow experience” in the context of PBL creates additional requirements as it might create a tension between guidance through the system and the learner’s focus when he is in a flow experience during his project investigation.
Communication facilities for learners and an embedment into social context (sharing, collaborating etc.) add elements of social media platforms to the PBL software system. Therefore, the design should follow the paradigms of modern social network platforms and incorporate aspects of PBL in the form of a content management system that enables adding content specific blocks. The known “Timeline” metaphor can be used to organize the personal view on shared objects and communication streams such as project notifications or tasks.
