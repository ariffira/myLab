### Thesis Title: Development of a web-platform to support Project based learning(PBL)

Electronic Project-based learning (ePBL) tool can be the ideal platform by using project-based learning(PBL) features in it. By the help of generic model and scientific papers about project-based learning gives the essential features of project-based learning. A new model of Project-based learning showed in this thesis which covers general characteristics that project-based education should have. This thesis also showed a comparison with existing project-based learning platforms, and activity flows of PBL, storyboard, related works, etc. Learners will engage in real-life problem/project and can track all their efforts, actions, feedbacks, results, presentations, discussions, collaboration, new ideas. They can share social context and showcase their work. In this work, we also talked about flow-experience support, timeline and data analytics. The outcomes of the project could be a single exportable artefact and documentation using the platform. The developed software prototype shown in this thesis is extendable and reusable.
